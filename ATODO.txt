BUGS
•get the metric field state to reflect what it shows when input is changed it is sometimes blank and sometimes from a previously created chart
currently it has validation to prevent you having blank state but I need to fix the root issue
•At certain screen widths the manage charts for overflows. need to handle overflow for each column
•Fix the metric field on the chart creator.

STYLING
• set a max width on the admin page forms and for charts

IN PROGRESS FEATURE
•let users set a default form 
I need to check to see if new users added have a settings feild making it to the db then get the user settings page to update it then get the input feild to respect it

Get new user to have the first element in list that they have permissions for as default

get auth state to hold userId and use it to update settings

need to read and possibly refactor auth state
